# BASIC CALCULATOR IN PYTHON
assign var and int then add bracket add input, where you write your 1st value
assign another var and add int then add bracket add input, where you write your 2nd value
assign third var where you will apply the operation
apply the logic by using if, elif, else statements
like: if operator double equal to (1st operation), apply the result
e.g = +,-,*,/

Note: We can write whatever you need to in variable part
Note: Logic must be the same , where we are wanted to be applied to perform operation
